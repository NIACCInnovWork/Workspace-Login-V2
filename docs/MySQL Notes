    SQL Transactions
        A transaction with the SQL database usually has four parts:
            1. Defining a cursor
            2. Creating your query
            3. Executing the query
            4. Committing the change or fetching the results

    Pulling Data from the Database
       Querying data always follows the following format
            SELECT [property] FROM [table]
       The property can be replaced by * to select all properties

       The keyword WHERE can be used to filter the data
            SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = 27

       Wild cards, %, and the keyword LIKE can be used to select partial data
            SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'Mi%'
       This will select records for people with names like "Mike", "Michael", "Michelle", etc.
       The wild card can also be used at both ends to get portions like '%ac%' to find a
            name that has 'ac' in it anywhere

       You are also able to limit your results from a query by using the LIMIT keyword
            SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5
       This code will only return 5 records, rather than loading the entire database
       Additionally, you don't have to have the limit start at the beginning, by using the OFFSET keyword
            SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5 OFFSET 2
       Returns records 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 instead of 1-5

       You can sort a query using the keywords ORDER BY
            SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name
       This will return alphabetized results
       Adding the keyword DESC will order the results descending instead

    When writing SQL commands, it is good to use "%s" as a placeholder fill in because it provides
        some level of security against SQL injections.


    Updating Record:
        UPDATE users SET age = 13 WHERE name = 'Bob'

    Deleting Record:
        DELETE FROM users WHERE name = 'Mike'
